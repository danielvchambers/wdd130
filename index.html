                Hello, my name is Daniel Chambers. I am from Utah, I currently
                live in Utah. I am an avid dnd player, I have been for several
                years. I am both a dungeon master and a player, I am currently
                running my own campaign and playing in 2 others. I currently
                drive public transit for a living to pay for school and that is
                me in a nutshell.
