                    <h4>The Frozen Pools</h4>
                    <p>
                        This is the most relaxing Raid that leads you through
                        the Fays Forest, where the trees grow up and over the
                        river, and into the Frozen Pools. This is the end of the
                        river where you can swim in the still water of the lake
                        and small pools. This is also the recommended one to
                        take that brave grandma on as well.

                    <h4>The Mountain Goat Escape</h4>
                    <p>
                        Ride our winding river as it follows the rocky cliffs.
                        You will follow the river as it leads you past the
                        Hunters Den and into the Windy Rapids. The Windy Rapids
                        will send you speading towards the Meditating Currents,
                        a slow flowing part of the river. Here, you might be
                        able to see the Mountain Goats as they travers the rocky
                        terrain. Then you will follow the river a little ways
                        more where you will find the end of your Raid.

                    <h4>The Hunters Den</h4>
                    <p>
                        At first, a relaxing ride that leads to the rocky cliffs
                        that stand tall over the river. Follow these cliffs as
                        they guide you to The Hunters Den. A small cave system
                        that leads to the other side of the rivers bend. At the
                        end of the cave, you will ride the Windy Rapids that
                        will give you a fast ride down the river to where you
                        will reach the end of your Raid.

                    <h4>The Dragon's Hoard</h4>
                    <p>
                        In this Raid, you will be going farther up river past
                        all the other Raids. Here, you will ride the Howling
                        Wails, the strongest currents in our river, as they lead
                        you through the mountains forest. When you reach the end
                        of the Howling Wails, you will be given the opportunity
                        to take a small hike to find the Dragon's Treasure. If
                        you find any, bring it back to receive a reward. Once
                        you are back in your raft, you will continue down the
                        river where you will reach the end of your Raid.
